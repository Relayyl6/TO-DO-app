To-Do List Application

This To-Do List Application is a simple, interactive web-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks efficiently. With an intuitive design, this app helps users stay organized and keep track of tasks that need to be completed.


Features

Add Tasks:
Users can input tasks into the text field and add them to the to-do list by pressing the "Add" button or hitting the Enter key.
Each new task is dynamically displayed as a list item on the page.

Check Tasks Off:
Users can click on any task to mark it as completed.
Marked tasks will be visually differentiated (e.g., by being crossed out or grayed out) to show they are done.

Delete Tasks:
Each task has a delete button (or icon) that allows users to remove it from the list.
Once a task is deleted, it is permanently removed from the list.

Persistent User Interface:
The clean and responsive user interface is built using CSS to ensure that the app works well across different screen sizes, including mobile devices.


Technologies Used

HTML: Structures the layout of the to-do list and its components, including the input field and task list.
CSS: Styles the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly, ensuring a responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles the interactive functionality of the app, including adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks.


How It Works

Adding a Task:
Enter a task in the input field and press the "Add" button (or hit Enter).
The task will be added as a list item in the to-do list.

Checking Off a Task:
Click on a task in the list to mark it as completed. This will toggle a checked state (usually visualized by striking through the text or changing its color).

Deleting a Task:
Each task will have a delete(x) button next to it. Clicking this button will remove the task from the list permanently.
